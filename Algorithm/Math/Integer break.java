The first thing we should consider is : What is the max product if we break a number N into two factors?

I use a function to express this product: f=x(N-x)

When x=N/2, we get the maximum of this function.

However, factors should be integers. Thus the maximum is (N/2)*(N/2) when N is even or (N-1)/2 *(N+1)/2 when N is odd.

When the maximum of f is larger than N, we should do the break.

(N/2)*(N/2)>=N, then N>=4

(N-1)/2 *(N+1)/2>=N, then N>=5

These two expressions mean that factors should be less than 4, otherwise we can do the break and get a better product. 
The factors in last result should be 1, 2 or 3. Obviously, 1 should be abandoned. Thus, the factors of the perfect product
should be 2 or 3.

The reason why we should use 3 as many as possible is

For 6, 3 * 3>2 * 2 * 2. Thus, the optimal product should contain no more than three 2.

Below is my accepted, O(N) solution.

class Solution {
    public int integerBreak(int n) {
        if (n == 2) return 1;
        if (n == 3) return 2;
        int product = 1;
        while (n > 4) {
            product *= 3;
            n -= 3;
        }
        product *= n;
        return product;
    }
}
